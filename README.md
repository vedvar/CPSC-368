# Investigating the Connection between Seasonal Precipitation and River Flow on Wildfire Severity

This project investigates the connection between annual precipitation and river flow on wildfire severity in the BC interior. As the meteorological processes that cause precipitation or drought are too complex to use as direct inputs for the scope of this project, we use historical annual precipitation and river flow data to make high-level predictions of the severity of wildfires the subsequent year.

### Data Sources:
  - Weather data obtained from the Meteorological Service of Canada at `https://climatedata.ca/download/#station-download`. This is historical daily observed weather station data from the Meteorological Service of Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada.
  - River flow data obtained from the Government of BC at `https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/hydrometric_data/resource/7a769e8a-1a36-4654-a176-037041f0e13e`. This is hydrometric data from various rivers around BC.
  - Wildfire data obtained from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System at `https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart/download/nfdbpnt`. This is a summary of the total area impacted by wildfires on an annual basis.
